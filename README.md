# Shop Kart - Front-end E-commerce App

Shop Kart is a front-end e-commerce application built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It utilizes the FakeStore API to fetch product data, Axios for making API calls, DOM APIs for manipulation, and Bootstrap for styling and UI components.

## Pages

1. **Home Page**: The landing page of the application, displaying featured products and promotions.
2. **Login Page**: Allows users to log in to their accounts.
3. **Product Detail Page**: Displays detailed information about a specific product, including images, description, price, and options to add to cart.
4. **Product List**: Lists all available products with options to filter and sort.
5. **Cart Page**: Shows the items added to the cart with options for editing and checkout.

## Functionality

1. **Loader**: Each page features a loader to indicate that the application is fetching data from the API. The loader is removed once the data is successfully fetched.

2. **Filtering**: Users can filter products based on minimum and maximum price ranges. Query parameters are utilized for this functionality, allowing users to set their desired price range.

3. **Segregation**: Products are segregated based on different categories or types, making it easier for users to navigate and find relevant items.
